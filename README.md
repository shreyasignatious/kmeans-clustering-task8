# 🧠 Task 8: K-Means Clustering – Mall Customer Segmentation

This project is part of my AI & ML Internship at Elivate Labs. It focuses on applying **K-Means Clustering**, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to segment customers based on their annual income and spending score using the Mall Customer dataset.

## 🎯 Objective

- Apply K-Means Clustering on real-world customer data
- Use the **Elbow Method** to choose the optimal number of clusters (K)
- Evaluate clustering performance using **Silhouette Score**
- Visualize clusters in 2D using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
